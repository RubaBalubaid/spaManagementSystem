# calm wind spa

calmWindSpa is a project for an Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) course. It implements various OOP concepts such as classes, objects, encapsulation, polymorphism, and interfaces.

1. Classes: Classes are blueprints for creating objects. In this project, classes could include "User", "Customer", "Employee", "Service", etc. Each class represents a specific entity in the system.

2. Objects: Objects are instances of classes. For example, when a user creates an account, an object of the "User" class is instantiated.

3. Encapsulation: Encapsulation is the bundling of data and methods that operate on the data into a single unit, i.e., a class. It helps in controlling the access to the data by providing getters and setters methods. In this project, encapsulation could be implemented by defining private attributes and providing public methods to access or modify them.

4. Polymorphism: Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. It enables flexibility and extensibility in the code. For example, both "Student" and "SpecialCustomer" classes can inherit from the "Customer" class and override its methods if necessary.

5. Interfaces: Interfaces define a contract for what methods a class must implement without providing the implementation details. In this project, an interface could be defined for services, specifying methods like "displayAvailableServices()" and "bookService()". Different classes representing types of services can implement this interface to provide their specific implementations.

Also, calmWindSpa system allows users to create accounts, select their role (customer or employee), and based on their role, they can access different functionalities such as viewing available services, booking appointments, etc. OOP concepts are applied throughout the project to organize and structure the code effectively.
